# Portfolio and Experience

### Technology I've had significant experience with include:

Python, R, Plotly, Dash, Docker[Compose], Airflow, Pyspark, Dask, Redis, SQL, Postgres, Snowflake and Poppler.

I have built models for most supervised learning algorithms, and a few unsupervised, mostly for customer segmentation type tasks. I have deep experience in marketing analytics from a platform and analysis perspective. Additionally, I have experience building and deploying analytical web apps, some with NLP based backends: Word Embeddings and Rule Based models. Finally, I have done several types of GIS related modeling such as Least Costs Paths Analysis and Spatial Regressions.

### Domains I have built solutions for

- Marketing Analytics
- Congressional Appropriations
- Food Tech
- Human Migration
- Healthcare
- Workforce Optimization



### Other tech I've used:

I have dabbled in causal modeling as an area of interest. I used a variety of Front-end tech to create this website. When I was a kid, I programmed a TI-83 Basic quadratic equation program to help me on my Algebra tests, though I don't know if that's relevant now :)
